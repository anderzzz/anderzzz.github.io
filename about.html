<!-- Variant: Standard Bio -->
<div class="variant-content" data-variant="standard-bio">
<p>Anders Öhrn holds a PhD in computational chemistry from Lund University, where his dissertation work combined statistical mechanics with quantum mechanical methods to model solvent effects on electronically excited molecular states. His subsequent career has spanned computational biology, consumer electronics, and machine learning across research and industry settings in Europe, North America, and East Asia. At Zymeworks Inc., he founded and led the Integration team responsible for bridging technical domains in antibody engineering, contributing to the development of asymmetric antibody scaffolds subsequently integrated into oncology therapeutics. As CTO at Nanoleaf, he oversaw product development for LED illumination systems and led successful grant applications totalling $2M USD. His current work focuses on developing LLM-based analytical systems for technical landscape analysis, including agentic workflows, semantic search architectures, and methods for systematic style analysis and replication. He maintains active interests in literature, philosophy, and classical studies.</p>

<!-- Variant: Sonnet -->
<div class="variant-content" data-variant="sonnet">
<p>I've counted electrons in their quantum dance<br>
And watched proteins fold like origami cranes,<br>
Crossed continents in hope, and not by chance<br>
Found junctions matter more than single lanes.</p>
<p>The clever trick is never quite enough—<br>
What wins is navigation, not the map,<br>
The will to work when working's mostly rough,<br>
And bridge the ever-widening domain gap.</p>
<p>Three cities taught me this: Lund, Vancouver, Shenzhen,<br>
Their factories and labs and library stacks,<br>
That atoms become bits become words, and then<br>
The word becomes the bridge that nothing lacks.</p>
<p>So now I build with language, glass, and leaf.<br>
The gift is given. Hold it. Life is brief.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I founded an Integration team. This is corporate for "the problems no one else want, give me!"</p>
<p>I helped design a lamp that sold in Apple Stores. It was counterfeited extensively. Social proof!</p>
<p>I have worked on three continents. This sounds cosmopolitan. But normally I stick with wine.</p>
<p>I like patents despite not being a lawyer. There, I said it -- sue me (like those patent trolls did <strong>barf</strong>).</p>
<p>I dug down to the very atoms, and I've been building myself back up from there ever since. </p>
<p>I know numbers. I know text. I suck at speech. That explains a lot about a lot.</p>
<p>I always play cooperate in coordination games. The reason is fear and trembling, the good kind. </p>
