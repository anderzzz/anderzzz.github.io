  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>This is Anders, a writer and thinker interested in literature, history, philosophy, and the classical tradition.</p>
<h2>What This Site Is</h2>
<p>A space for longer-form writing—essays, reflections, and arguments about books, ideas, and the enduring questions that ancient and modern thinkers have grappled with.</p>
<p>The writing here tends toward:
- <strong>Literature</strong>: How we read, what we read, and why certain books endure
- <strong>History</strong>: Not just what happened, but how we understand what happened
- <strong>Philosophy</strong>: Ideas about knowledge, ethics, meaning, and how to live
- <strong>Classical Studies</strong>: Greek and Roman thought, literature, and their influence on Western intellectual history</p>
<h2>Why This Exists</h2>
<p>Most online writing is optimized for speed—hot takes, quick threads, disposable content. This site is deliberately slower. The essays here are meant to be read carefully, perhaps more than once.</p>
<p>The goal isn't to persuade you of a particular worldview, but to think through difficult questions with clarity and honesty. Sometimes that means defending unpopular positions. Sometimes it means changing my mind.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>This site doesn't have comments, but you can reach me via <a href="mailto:you@example.com">email</a> if you'd like to discuss something I've written.</p>
