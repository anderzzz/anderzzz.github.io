      <h2>About</h2>

      <p>I write about literature, history, philosophy, and the classical tradition—subjects that reward slow thinking and repay rereading.</p>

      <p>My approach is straightforward: read closely, think independently, and argue when necessary. I'm more interested in what's true than what's fashionable, which occasionally means disagreeing with received wisdom.</p>

      <p>I'm drawn to questions that don't have clean answers: What makes a work of literature endure? How do we read ancient texts without flattening them into contemporary categories? Why do certain ideas persist across centuries while others vanish?</p>

      <p>The classical tradition matters to me not because it's old, but because it's good—and because engaging seriously with the past gives us better tools for thinking about the present.</p>
