  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I'm Anders Öhrn, and my career has been a journey from bits to atoms and back again.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I started as a chemist, moved into computational chemistry, dove into mathematics, led technology as CTO for a consumer electronics company, and now work in AI development. Throughout this trajectory, the constant has been seeing information as fundamental—the bits that move atoms, the patterns that shape matter.</p>
<p>That perspective colors everything I write here. Whether examining policy principles, technological change, or how we make decisions under uncertainty, I tend to look for the underlying patterns and first principles.</p>
<h2>What You'll Find Here</h2>
<p>This site is for longer-form thinking about:
- Decision-making frameworks and their limitations
- Technology and its second-order effects
- Policy, institutions, and unexamined assumptions
- Philosophy, particularly when it intersects with science and technology
- Occasionally: literature, history, and classical studies</p>
<p>The writing aims to be clear and direct. I prefer examining ideas on their merits over following any particular ideological line. Sometimes that means defending unpopular positions. Sometimes it means changing my mind.</p>
<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>Most online writing optimizes for engagement—hot takes, quick reactions, disposable content. This site deliberately aims for depth over speed. The essays here are meant to be read carefully, perhaps more than once.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to build an audience or personal brand. This is a space for working through difficult questions honestly, in public, with the benefit of feedback from readers who care about getting things right.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>You can reach me via <a href="mailto:your-email@example.com">email</a> if you'd like to discuss something I've written. I don't have comments enabled, but I do appreciate thoughtful responses.</p>
