  <h2>Taipei, Taiwan, A Vegetarian Food Reflection</h2>
  <time datetime="2025-12-30">30 December 2025</time>

  <p>A unique ingredient in Taiwanese vegetarian cuisine is the lump of gluten, usually braised or soaked in something spicy. It is indeed the same gluten of bread, but here in its crosslinked form, like a mesh of editable stuff, and washed free of the starch of the wheat flour. It is therefore not like an oversoaked crouton, but neither like tofu or meat, quite its own thing. A nice protein injection that is not derived from beans or peas.</p>
<p>Another example of Taiwan flexing its muscles on creative vegetarian food is mushrooms in all kinds of meat textured designs. The most memorable to me was a Lion’s Mane mushroom, soaked, spiced and dunked in sauce that made it seem like a meatloaf.</p>
<p>And that block staple of vegetarian cook books, the tofu (豆腐), can be found in swanky restaurants and steamy street vendors, in an enormous variety of formats. Soft and wobbly, skin or lump, hard spicy or stringy noodle-like, or for those who want their animal kingdom component, tofu merged with egg or blood can also be found.</p>
<p>In the 2010s the idea of creating an exact meat burger from vegetable sources became a hot commodity in Silicon Valley investing. The exact biotechnology may vary, but a common design was to extract protein from Canadian split pea, enrich the heme protein for the bloody feeling, and then market it as a burger fit for the barbecue feast.</p>
<p>I’ve tried that too. Back when it was a novelty, I went to a Los Angeles brunch restaurant and ate the chef's prepared impossible burger. I remember the dark interior, the creaky seating, all very tough like gym muscles and flawless beard grooming. The burger specifics I’ve forgotten. Nothing wrong with it, I’ve concluded after trying it again a few times in more pedestrian settings.</p>
<p>Yet, what can be had in Taiwan as far as vegetarian food is concerned, even when limited to the pseudo-meat variety, is more varied and better. It really stands apart in style.</p>
<p>I suspect a durable influence of Buddhism, especially the Mahayana variety, is to thank for this. Unlike the Buddhism of Thailand or Tibet, Mahayana, which is centred in eastern China and Taiwan, requires its adherents to eat vegetarian. Add to that Taiwan’s recent relative wealth and political history free of extreme forms of materialism and starvation, and one can imagine how a refined vegetarian cuisine has emerged even outside the health conscious, ecology aware and animal friendly cohorts.</p>
<p>Regardless of ultimate cause, Taiwan presents a case of refined vegetarian food that plays along the full range of formats, not only trying to navigate from ground beef preferences. And that has served Taiwan, and visitors to the island, very well.</p>
<p>Three places to consider in this category:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.yu-shan-ge.com.tw/">Yu Shan Ge</a>, in the Zhong Zheng district, not that far off from the electronics market.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/delisoys/">DeliSoys</a>, in the Da An district, a touch north of SOGO.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.littletreefood.com/">Little Tree Food</a>, with several locations, like in Dunnan.</li>
</ul>
<p>And the street vendors require some luck and local knowledge to find at any given time, but are worth looking for.</p>
