  <h2>Math to Save Civilization</h2>
  <time datetime="2025-12-19">19 December 2025</time>

  <p>It has been claimed that young adults of today, especially university undergraduates, are far less able to read and engage with a lengthy argument in written form. Also, the classics of English literature appear to have become less accessible to the present batch of students set to read Austen, Dickens, Defoe and the rest in that august row of authors. <a href="https://jmarriott.substack.com/p/the-dawn-of-the-post-literate-society-aa1?utm_campaign=post-expanded-share&amp;utm_medium=post%20viewer&amp;triedRedirect=true">James Marriott</a> in particular has talked and written about an impending post-literate society and that trends in literacy, reading for pleasure and other long-form reading habits are for the first time in broad decline. The data to support these claims are quite strong and the hypothesized reasons point to the changing forms of consumption of media generally with the advent of smartphones and the social media scroll.</p>
<p>To varying degrees of intensity, the commentary points to a concomitant decline in cognitive abilities. The short-form, interrupted engagement with text is said to create less of something within the typical student’s mind, which in past decades was helpful to the development of the skills that are presently in decline. A profound change in technology may very well have caused, at least in the aggregate, a loss of a human skill we have become used to, maybe even built our liberal democratic societies upon.</p>
<h1>How and How Not Post-Literacy Is Like Organic Farming</h1>
<p>At a surface level, there is a more extreme case to be made about farming and growing one’s food. Very few young people or adults know how to grow vegetables, churn butter, keep hens, or butcher a pig. Go back not decades, but more like one or two centuries, depending on where one’s ancestors lived, and most in the population understood what it took to turn a piece of land into energy and nutrition for the human body.</p>
<p>A person so inclined could use this more extreme case of loss of a skill as a launching point into a critique of processed food, high-fructose bits and bobs, agri-tech and pollution. I will not, however, because although there are faults with a great deal of what most of us eat nowadays, I don’t think those faults are inexorably linked to the transition from a mostly agricultural society to one of manufacturing and services. There are ample markets that serve people who want to eat healthy, fresh, local, organic, ethical, ethnic, non-cruel, paleolithic and a whole host of food types without fully or even in part exiting modern society. As long as some people possess the skills to grow food, the benefits of their skills can be bought by others without the skill.</p>
<p>The fact that fewer people know how to make their own food from nature and agriculture is a small problem in comparison with the major benefits of modernization, and a problem that can be solved without reverting to lifestyles of previous centuries. That most individuals have lost this skill does not imply starvation nor that we are forced to eat whatever slop emerges from a deep fryer.</p>
<p>But I qualified this case of farming as being similar to the case of post-literacy only at the surface level. The case of reading places a greater emphasis on that reading itself, or specifically reading extended arguments or prose with subtle metaphors and metonymy, refashions the individual, and alters minds in the direction of better. Though there are some who no doubt would argue that only through manual labour on the fields, in nature, near one’s ancestral home, affords the individual an authentic appreciation of place and nature, my sense is that the pro-pastoralist argument has a great deal more ground to cover before people in general recognize dangers to the social fabric than what is true for arguments about loss of literacy. </p>
<p>A great deal of reading is done in order to produce output. That would be the case for the considerable amount of reading lawyers do, for example, which has become a service one can trade as one navigates ever mounting laws and regulations. Some reading is for momentary entertainment and escapism, which was the bulk of reading that took off in the 18th and 19th centuries. These are some functions of reading.</p>
<p>The critics of the post-literate society, as far as I understand them, are concerned rather with the loss of formative reading among people generally. That includes information and arguments about the political choices of citizens that in the democratic process convert into laws that apply to all, since a too great detachment from reality of nature, society or fellow citizens leads to bad incentives for the politicians and that, over time, to poor governance. Exactly what the threshold values are is unclear, though, and some limiting principle is needed to complete the argument—after all, many lowly educated citizens of the past elected capable leaders and they then rose to great challenges when called upon. The post-literacy critics are only one step removed from snobbery and class prejudice.</p>
<p>The formative aspect of reading also includes the appreciation of the human condition. Seeing life through other minds, feeling their joys and struggles, would in this understanding create ways for men and women to change, less by argument, more by the feeling of inhabiting the space of another human, a fellow citizen.</p>
<p>I hope to have delineated that reading is both special and not. A great deal of reading is a service that can be traded just like an organically farmed potato can be. That fewer people can read and adapt to laws and regulations is an economic problem, since it raises the knowledge barriers to lawful activity and raises the rents charged by those who can read. But it is hardly the civilizational problem the post-literacy critics point to. Rather, what is at stake is precisely that feature of reading that does not conclude with a deliverable, but which forms the individual reader in some way to become a better member of his community. If the critics are right, this is a deep loss of an ability or quality that we do not solve through better markets in which goods and services of complementarily skilled people are traded. </p>
<h1>Mathematics and Abstractions of Modern Society</h1>
<p>As much as I appreciate a hefty book, loaded with a challenging and serious story, I have done more work in mathematics than in literature. The mathematical education I received was by the standards even then, old-fashioned. Part of learning how to integrate, solve systems of differential equations, or use Green’s theorem, was to also know definitions by heart, and to be able to write down the proofs of theorems on a black board and reason through them with the professor looking on. I even studied number theory, the purest form of mathematics, the least applied one. </p>
<p>Like literacy, mathematical skills have been on a decline in recent times. PISA scores for math have generally been declining relative to previous years, and evidence from at least the UK and Robert Coe’s research proves grade inflation is real. The contents of math education have also been in flux during the 20th century with relatively advanced Euclidean geometry being replaced with less abstract arithmetic. Though, if we expand the considerations further in time and accounting for social class, citizens generally are better educated in math than in the 19th century. Prussia was a trend setter when in the early 19th century they included relatively advanced mathematics, which other European countries adopted in degrees in the century that followed.</p>
<p>Mathematics has many applications, and very many of the benefits of mathematical skills can be acquired without knowing any mathematics. For example, the means by which this text is stored on a server, transported from there to a client and displayed on a screen, is enabled by mathematics, and was designed by mathematically trained persons, and mostly used by people who do not know anything about it. In that sense, it is like the transactional relation between farmer and the consumer of organically grown potato, and not necessarily of concern, since large markets give everyone access to the benefits of the most advanced mathematics.</p>
<p>But does a feature of mathematics exist that operates like the serious and formative aspects of reading and literature? I think there is a plausible case for it, though distinct from literacy.</p>
<p>Starting at the other end, the aspect of mathematical knowledge most similar to political literacy is the ability to grasp the quantitative substance of an argument. Concepts like exponential growth, percentages and the arithmetic average are useful to understand. The list can be made longer as the sophistication of the argument increases (Simpson’s Paradox is a good one). Except in rare cases, I expect that if citizens have become less literate, then already prior to that, they would have lost the ability to reason quantitatively. Furthermore, many relevant and good faith political arguments do not engage in quantitative reasoning, and therefore lack of mathematical skills is less of a limitation. I conclude from these suppositions that the loss of literacy is worse than reduced skills in mathematics. </p>
<p>Mathematics training of the pure kind expands and hones the student’s ability to engage in abstract thought and to perform the cognitive efforts of manipulating abstract entities. This is more than logical deduction. Theorems and proofs are inherently about abstract things, which follow certain rules, where the rules build on more fundamental rules for more fundamental things. The formulation of the problem is itself an art.</p>
<p>This way to problem formulation and solution rhymes with another facet of modern society at national scales and greater. Abstraction is part of good governance. Tax rates are personal, but they also affect entities not immediately part of the citizen’s life, but which indirectly matters nonetheless. Say, the corporate tax, which is paid by very few directly, but which removes investment capital from companies engaged in research and factory expansions. Or a regulation mandating additional paperwork by market participants of which the citizen is not one, can still impact parts of society the citizen cares about because added barriers to entry for new market participants lower dynamism and funnel cash flows to compliance officers, lawyers, notaries etc.</p>
<p>More empathy, a greater depth of feelings for the fellow man and woman, or an ability to walk in someone else’s shoes, are not that helpful to settle these abstract governance issues. It is precisely the reduction of human actions into abstract processes, and the adoption of a perspective removed from the domains of embodied feelings and wants, which is the most constructive to optimization. The scale of issues a citizen of a modern nation takes part in, are such that taking too many feelings appropriate for the interpersonal sphere into account, confuse and misdirect more than they help.</p>
<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0100115">Västfjäll and Slovic</a> have shown for example that people's charitable giving is often inefficient in that they favour small and targeted fixes, rather than giving support to larger scale life-saving projects. The empathy most humans feel is aimed at individuals or smaller and identifiable groups, which therefore misdirects how we act charitably at greater scale. This is a case where a math-inspired, rather than literary, frame of mind can convert donations to more lives improved by recipients, which is the stated aim of charity.</p>
<p>I offer the hypothesis that congruent with the way a citizen’s ability to engage with community and other people is honed by literature and reading longer stories and personal testimony, the citizen’s ability to engage with the abstract features of social governance and organization are honed by mathematics, the purer the better. If reading about young ladies’ woes of the Victorian era or about those of a teenage novice in the Orthodox Church of the 1870s Russia can induce us to become better humans in interpersonal matters, then it is not unreasonable that burrowing oneself into the pure mathematical domain can to a degree make us better at seeing the great structures at work as effects follow from causes.</p>
<p>I am however doubtful pure mathematics is either necessary or sufficient. That is, there are other ways to attain this ability as citizens of modern societies, and that a person fluent in algebra and number theory can be bad at navigating the world of social abstractions. But the citizens that have carefully worked their way through tricky algebra and geometry, considered the abstract symbols and entities and manipulated them in their minds, aided perhaps by pen and paper, chalk and blackboard, have grown their minds in the direction of abstract social thought. The formative efforts tilt expected outcomes in one direction. I expect a similar hedge from the honest literature critic, since well-read sociopaths and poorly-read yet virtuous citizens are known to exist.</p>
<p>The post-literacy critics have developed a sophisticated account of what is lost when reading declines—an account that goes beyond the instrumental value of literacy to its formative effects on the citizen’s capacity for fellow-feeling and political judgment. When we advocate for mathematical education, we speak of engineering careers and national economic and military priorities. These are real considerations, but they are considerations of the organic-farming kind: they concern services that can be traded, benefits that can be acquired from the most mathematically adept by those who are not. </p>
<p>Less articulated is whether mathematics, particularly in its purer forms, might cultivate a mode of thought essential to citizenship in societies whose governance operates increasingly through abstraction, at scales where empathy alone is a poor guide. I like to think so. Industry and information operating at national and international scales require a different frame of mind than the hearth and the village. If our canon of formative education is to serve citizens of the modern state, it may benefit from rebalancing—a bit more Diophantus than Diogenes, some extra Gauss over Goethe. Not to displace the poets, but to stand alongside them.</p>
