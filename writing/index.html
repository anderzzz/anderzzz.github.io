          <a href="/writing/example-post.html">On the Necessity of Rereading</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="article-meta">20 November 2025</p>
        <p class="article-excerpt">Why returning to books we've already read is not mere repetition, but a different act of reading entirely—and what the ancients understood about this that we've forgotten.</p>
      </li>

        <h3 class="article-title">
          <a href="#">The Problem with Historical Consensus</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="article-meta">15 November 2025</p>
        <p class="article-excerpt">Academic history tends toward convergence, but the best historical thinking often emerges from productive disagreement. On why we should be suspicious of neat narratives.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="article-title">
          <a href="#">What Cicero Got Wrong About Friendship</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="article-meta">8 November 2025</p>
        <p class="article-excerpt">De Amicitia is beautiful and wrong. A closer look at what the Roman conception of friendship misses—and what that reveals about ancient vs. modern social bonds.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="article-title">
          <a href="#">Against Reading Lists</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="article-meta">1 November 2025</p>
        <p class="article-excerpt">The tyranny of the to-read pile and why the best reading is often unplanned. On serendipity, obsession, and letting books find you.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3 class="article-title">
          <a href="#">The Stoics Were Not Stoic</a>
        </h3>
        <p class="article-meta">28 October 2025</p>
        <p class="article-excerpt">Modern interpretations of Stoicism flatten it into self-help. Reading Marcus Aurelius and Epictetus on their own terms reveals something stranger and more interesting.</p>
