  <h2>Rebound is Good</h2>
  <time datetime="2026-01-03">3 January 2026</time>

  <p>Some years ago, on a bus from Shenzhen to Hong Kong in the evening, I could look out, shortly before the end of the journey, at the animated facade of one of the tall buildings on the Kowloon side of the city, I believe the International Commerce Centre. The animation consisted of synchronized LED lights, spread over the sizable facade, and they played different animations — I recall the shape of a whale seemingly swimming across the building surface. It was a good look, far more enticing than the seedy aesthetics of the neon lights.</p>
<p>Whale shaped facade lighting would hardly be practical with incandescence or fluorescent lighting technology, either because of the electrical costs or the maintenance burden. With LEDs it is practical, however, because they only require around 10% of the electricity of an incandescent bulb to generate the equivalent amount of illumination, their lifetimes are measured in years, not in months, and input current converts instantly to output light. This is a case of lighting beyond just illumination. LEDs have continued ever since to be deployed in places and for reasons no incandescent or fluorescent ever would—or what about BMW grill lights, accentuating the famous kidney grille.</p>
<h2>What is the Rebound Effect?</h2>
<p>If we did an accounting of all lighting usage, especially of the electrical power inputs, in the days prior to abundant LEDs, and from that number forecasted that we would use only 10% of that for our lighting needs once LEDs are fully deployed, we would be wrong by a great deal. I am not suggesting actual analyses in the early days of LED technology were this naive. However, the focus in government reports and industry discourse was decidedly in favour of the analysis of retrofitting existing illumination solutions with their LED near-equivalents. The total amount of light produced nowadays is much greater than any retrofitting analysis would sum up to.</p>
<p>The difference is called a rebound effect, or a case of Jevons’ Paradox after William Stanley Jevons, who noted it first in the 19th century with respect to coal consumption. The term denotes the additional consumption of something—such as the number of lumens of lighting, kilometres travelled, or centigrades of indoor temperature—upon introduction of a more efficient technology. There are many cases of it and economists crunch numbers to unearth further examples thereof. That some degree and kind of rebound takes place in the aggregate in the wake of technology development is therefore the rule, not the exception.</p>
<h2>Why Is Rebound Happening?</h2>
<p>But why would the shapes of whales on a skyscraper’s facade be what drove the rebound, in a small, but prominent way when good enough LEDs became possible to mass-manufacture? As the improved diode technology, in particular the invention of blue-light emitting diodes, relaxed the constraint between energy costs and lighting outputs, some human wish, desire or need was expressed in the wider range of more accessible possibilities. That expression is worth a closer inspection.</p>
<p>I do so by way of the age-old human activity I was taking part in back when I observed those shimmering whale shapes in nighttime Hong Kong: commuting between work and residence. </p>
<p>Marchetti’s constant is a key quantity when it comes to commuting. It is named after the Italian physicist Cesare Marchetti, who noted the remarkable constancy of the duration of people’s commute time, from the Ancient Roman era to modern times. The typical duration is half an hour one way, what changes is the distance, as the speed of travel increases thanks to technology. So in the times of the Romans, when walking was the mode of transport, the typical distance from home and work was the typical walking speeds on Roman streets multiplied by half an hour. With cars and highways, the distances go up as the speeds of transport go up, while the duration is more or less constant.</p>
<p>So when transport speeds accelerate, the commute duration rebounds—and if Marchetti is correct, by 100%, such that the total time investment going to and from work remains the same. In principle, time could be saved by the more efficient mode of transport. Instead the relaxed constraints lead to individuals in the aggregate moving further away from work, say by moving into the suburbs or buying a house in the tranquil woods. Or is it that work and business centralize in cities and into larger workplaces when people can reach there from farther away?</p>
<p>Regardless, this rebound is revealing because we can conclude that over a wide range of transport speeds, people living in vastly different conditions still prioritize place over commute duration. The rebound is therefore an effect of an understandable preference of making the best of one’s dwelling place first, within the constraints of travel time to work.</p>
<h2>Rebound Means Something Good Happened</h2>
<p>Rebound complicates environmental accounting, certainly. When efficiency gains don't translate into proportional resource savings, those tracking emissions or waste have more complex sums to do. But complexity is not tragedy.</p>
<p>I see rebound as something to celebrate. It is a numeric testament to humans finding ways to delight, be better and creative when free. More efficient technology creates more choice, therefore more freedom. If the old outputs were exactly as good as we wanted, no problem—the more efficient technology makes old ways more affordable and less taxing. But zero rebound would be the strange outcome, a signal that human aspiration had somehow reached its terminus, and we are left to make our current ways more efficient and nothing else. When rebound appears in the economists' reports, it means new choices have been made, new uses imagined.</p>
<p>In the liberal mindset, where freedom is in itself good, rebound is a signal of something good. The whales on Hong Kong facades at night are highly visible signals of good. A lighting designer had been freed by efficient LEDs to create expression.</p>
<h2>The Ode to Creativity, Rebound Its Tune</h2>
<p>Freedom exercised can burden others, including those not yet born. Rebound does not guarantee that every new use upon technological change is wise or that our institutions will adapt gracefully to changed conditions—history suggests they often lag. But the signal itself, the evidence that people found new ways to express preference or joy when constraints relaxed, that remains good. The failures may coincide with rebound, but they are not because of rebound.</p>
<p>So when the economists tally up the rebound and find that we did not, after all, save 90% of our lighting energy, I see in their tables a kind of census of human aspiration. Each lumen beyond the retrofit forecast is a choice made, a preference expressed, a small declaration that mere adequacy was not enough. The commuter who moves to the house in the woods, the designer who specifies a luminous facade, the driver whose grille gleams in the evening traffic—these are not failures of efficiency. They are exercises of freedom made newly possible.</p>
<p>That evening on the bus from Shenzhen, I was not witnessing waste. I was watching a city adorn itself because it finally could. The blue-light diodes that made it possible were developed for other purposes. Efficient technology, like a mythological spirit, has a way of handing us back our hours and making room for our options, and then standing aside to see what we do with them. Humans imagined whales, designed them, budgeted the task, hired and deployed. And for a few minutes, a tired commuter looked up from his seat and felt something like wonder. This is what rebound measures, finally: not a failure of efficiency, but the distance between adequacy and aspiration.</p>
