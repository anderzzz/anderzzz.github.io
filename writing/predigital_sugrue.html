  <h2>Pre-Digital Sugrue, a Contemporary YouTube Phenomenon</h2>
  <time datetime="2026-01-11">11 January 2026</time>

  <p>At some point a few years before the COVID-19 pandemic, Stoicism found a moment’s revival, at least in the North American discourse. A thesis in sociology awaits to be written on it. Perhaps the mystics like a piece of the action as well, as the moment oddly appeared shortly prior to the uncertain and decentred world that followed. </p>
<p>But in this essay, Stoicism is no more than the gateway to Michael Sugrue. </p>
<p>As any self-respecting guy doing his own research, I came across in that mystical mist a then recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auuk1y4DRgk">uploaded lecture on YouTube</a>, where the aforementioned man, in beige jacket and slacks with a tie and glasses, in a clearly dated video, walked to and fro a studio stage talking. And talking. And talking. No script in sight, no hums or ers between words or sentences, just delivering unadulterated narrative.</p>
<p>The opening stanzas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After the death of Socrates and the break up of Greek culture that resulted from the Peloponnesian war, Socratic philosophy went into a decline and fragmented into several pieces, and the fragments of Socratic philosophy make up the body of Hellenistic philosophy. What I mean by Hellenistic philosophy is the subsequent developments of Greek philosophy which take their cue from the Socratic approach to philosophy, yet they don't have all the components parts of Socratic philosophy. They usually lack the wit, they almost always lack the poetry, occasionally they absorb some of the ethical doctrine or epistemological doctrines, but the ones who come after Socrates, they never live up to the Socratic ideal.</p>
<p>The three main fragments of Socratic philosophy breaks into are called Stoicism, Epicureanism, and Skepticism. And these are the most important Hellenistic outgrowths from Socratic philosophy. And since Rome–the Roman Empire in particular–is the political entity, which ultimately dominates the Mediterranean basin and absorbs and inherits the tradition of Greek philosophy, most of the Hellenistic branches of philosophy are developed in connection, or with reference to, either politically or intellectually, with Roman culture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What follows is a good forty minutes of lecture on Marcus Aurelius and the Stoic Ideal. Always clear and calmly animated in form, though free from any other imagery than Sugrue’s steady pacing in front of a studio audience, who always remain anonymous, nothing more than outlines of heads, like we would see if we were seated in the audience, a few rows behind the front row. </p>
<p>Sugrue’s lecture is philosophical in content with a dose of wake-the-fuck-up-ness without the gym body or jiujitsu subplot to go with it. Marcus becomes in Sugrue’s telling, that beacon of getting good stuff done, despite extreme temptation to wallow in self-pity or indulge in sensual pleasures, all through the stoic focus on virtue and that which is in one’s control. Many have interpreted Marcus’ text, seen in it the foundations of cognitive behavioural therapy or the best manual to survive war, if war is visited upon you.</p>
<p>A point Sugrue makes is that philosophy is a great leveller. Marcus as emperor and Epictetus as slave were both stoics. The wise man lives in accordance with nature, who does not abdicate his moral responsibilities, who does what is good. A ruthless kind of approach. Yet a philosophy both emperor and slave can understand and live by, if they have the fortitude, if they understand their own souls.   </p>
<p>I referred to this online video as a gateway, since it introduced me to Sugrue’s vast number of other videos. Most filmed in the same fashion, as a staged lecture, quite often with a light blue backdrop, like we’ve been invited into a neat summer house for learning by an erudite and very well-spoken man of great learning.</p>
<p>And for all my comments on the form and style, with its 1990s resolution and self-conscious stage, the content of Sugrue’s YouTube channel is truly excellent. </p>
<p>He was a content creator from the era prior to content creation, beamed into our future condition, who now speaks through the medium of contemporary YouTube with authenticity. His words are not shaped in service of becoming an influencer or growing a monetizable audience, nor swayed in one way or the other by comment sections. In 2024, Sugrue in his sixties, passed away from cancer.</p>
<p>To illustrate his approach and style, I highlight the content of three of his many videos.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-vcItYxM9U">His lecture on Kant’s moral philosophy</a></strong>. The textbook categorical imperative is given a great deal of context, both forward into our modern era, and backward to the debates with Hume and Plato. Sugrue is vividly painting the extraordinary ambition in Kant’s efforts. A pious, hardworking, German Protestant, embracing, not submitting to nor refusing, the challenge the new Newtonian physics posed—if Newton could for that slice of the existence, so could Kant for this slice of it all.</p>
<p>From that bit of, shall we say, individually particular and historically situated narrative, the great Enlightenment ethics is born that applies to all rational people and things, nations included, and for all time. To bluntly style-transfer the message to the pointed and provocative digital-online expressions, I'd summarize the mood of Sugrue's philosophical narrative of Kant's ambition and project in the following styling.</p>
<p><img alt="Kant's universal ethics versus postmodern relativism" src="https://anderzzz.github.io/images/writing/kant_meme.png"></p>
<p>Another one of Sugrue's remarks that has stayed with me: "One of the problems with German philosophy as a whole is that there's not much in the way of clarity or elegance of style. The easy and directly accessible philosophers tend to write in English, for better or worse, the more difficult philosophy like that of Kant, you find among the German.”</p>
<p>A very refreshing quality of Sugrue’s approach is that, apart from the note on Kant’s difficult style, Sugrue presents the subject matter in the most confident frame. He inhabits the philosopher’s approach in the clearest, maximally ambitious and awesome in its intellectual creation. From his stage somewhere in the past, Sugrue conjures Kant as a most awesome intellectual figure.</p>
<p>It is a joyful style. I want to give the subject matter further thought.</p>
<p>From Sugrue’s many other lectures, it is clear, though, he is not simply a loud and proud adherent to deontology, who sees nothing to debate or critique in Kant. But the stage performance is not about critique or declaring a program. </p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1Rp1OiFCK0">His lecture on Meister Eckhart</a></strong>. Over several video lectures—I counted to seventeen—Sugrue discusses the Bible, many of its key texts, how to approach its interpretation as well as some of its key interpreters from Medieval to contemporary era. </p>
<p>One lecture that stands out is the one where he considers Christianity through the perspective of Meister Eckhart. In the process, Sugrue makes a strong case for Western mysticism. He points to Meister Eckhart’s incredibly compact and rich aphorisms, free of Nietzschean bite, which evokes that which we cannot quite talk of, gestures towards something foundational, rather than outlining and X-raying it. </p>
<p>With a smile and wink to the audience, Sugrue says he is tempted to think of Meister Eckhart as the great unsystematic theologian in Christianity as contrasted with Aquinas, who is the great systematic one, with volumes to prove it. What one can say about God, Aquinas does a fine job, Sugrue states, and adds, that in terms of what what can not say about God, Meister Eckhart does an even better job. </p>
<p>True to style, Sugrue presents an evocative case for Eckhart’s angle to ultimate philosophy. Rather than putting questions, answers and theses on a blackboard, Sugrue speaks eloquently about Eckhart’s contributions to Christian thought through a current of spoken words.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RLhq0jsnbM">His lecture on Roland Barthes’ Semiotics</a></strong>. The French postmodernists present a different challenge. Their rejection of grand projects and extraordinary self-consciousness, especially with respect to language, make it often quite hard to grasp what is being said. The postmodernist thinker is as much a creature of the postmodern condition, performing within it, never fully able to stand outside it, explaining it.</p>
<p>Sugrue helps to make sense of Roland Barthes’ approach to popular culture and contemporary artefacts of Barthes mid-20th century vantage point. From his homely constructed stage in sky blue hue, an ancient map on the wall and a bookshelf in the corner, Sugrue tells the viewer that Barthes understood his task at first as demythologizing the text or the symbol, be it commercials, photographs or cinema, and uncover the ideology that lurks beneath. </p>
<p>But in the second-half of Mythologies, which Sugrue states is a pleasurable book to read—a rare quality—Barthes subverts the Marxist reading of symbols, and notes that the critic of culture, the presumptive demythologizer, is unavoidably engaged in remythologizing. There is no unmasking to reveal the ugly face of reality, there is only another mask. </p>
<p>Sugrue interprets Barthes as creating room for free play. If the artist provides a path to see and feel nature, imperfect and subjective, nonetheless a path, then the critic constructs a path to art, so there is even more room to explore and engage with text and symbols. In that part of the lecture, the uninterrupted, lyrical form of Sugrue reaches new heights.</p>
<p>Again, he makes it all sound so awesome, this time also rather pleasurable.</p>
<p>Many are free to claim to have the answers to what is the right philosophy or the right interpretation of this or that philosopher’s philosophy. As many can disagree and critique. We end up with a smorgasbord of thought.</p>
<p>I note this because a lecturer who speaks so well and confidently for a mere forty minutes, or so, about great texts and grand figures of philosophy invites the critique of being wrong in parts or for being insufficiently deep. I am not here to fact check Sugrue, though from what I can tell, he is well within the bounds of plausible and defensible.</p>
<p>However, as I keep coming back to above, Sugrue is not on his stage to present a set of measured and examined claims, and poke at their soft spots for critique. He is far closer to enacting a performance through words of the most awesome and appreciative interpretations of the many nuggets of Western philosophy—the inverse of online dunking where the least charitable path rules. His style inspires an audience to the next step.</p>
<p>Normally a presentation on YouTube that is a bit too confident, stylish and perfectly unscripted would arouse a commensurate bit of distrust in me. Even more so if it is playing my apparent tune. The medium of contemporary YouTube comes with a hermeneutics of distrust. Every polished performance carries the shadow of strategy, every confident voice the suspicion of an angle being worked with engagement and click-through-rates as guiding lights. </p>
<p>If it was a commercial, I understand the message comes with an ask. The confident voice, sleek design or impeccable torso are not just there, rather the stuff of a sales funnel, which I may want to jump into or not. At least I am aware it is a funnel jump I’m offered. And the funnel is anchored by the product on offer.</p>
<p>A YouTube video headlined with the content creator photo-face emoji, a.k.a. Mr Beast face, brought to my feed and search results signals that something believes I will click this thing. But even more so, that the content as such is tuned for my attention. The joyful, kind or spontaneous are too often, too easily appearing staged. So might that outdated beige jacket and those lyrical moments of the mystical nature of words and symbols be spoken to tickle the engagement of my monetizable cohort?</p>
<p>Well no. Sugrue, as a creator prior to the recommender algorithm escapes this suspicion. The reason I came in contact with him may have been thanks to a well-tuned search algorithm, which recognized that I was in need of some serious stoic content. A job well done, oh algorithm. However, the content as such, its text and symbols, were from a place these optimizations do not reach. The suspicious stance does not fit. I am free to drop the guard a little and indulge in the staged and fluent lecture.</p>
<p>I do not say that only video excavated from times prior to contemporary YouTube can have this quality, I think there are other means. What I note is that there is such a quality to be had in the first place. The medium is not neutral in this regard. It meddles with the symbols and how I receive them. Analogous to that Marcus Aurelius key book was not meant to become public impacts how we understand his words, even when now public, the fact that Sugrue did not produce his content for YouTube monetization and follower reach, though they now work like that, has an effect on what his words do to our intellectual journey.</p>
<p>For the philosophically curious, I can nothing but recommend the pre-digital Sugrue on YouTube and his excellent stage performances.</p>
