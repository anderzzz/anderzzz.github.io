  <h2>How Does the Precautionary Principle Work and Why It Is Unfit</h2>
  <time datetime="2025-11-28">28 November 2025</time>

  <p>There are many variations to the formulation of the <em>precautionary principle</em>. At heart, the principle pertains to a social choice, which can bring about <em>or</em> prevent a state of affairs deemed especially detrimental, and where the certainty in the relationship between choice and outcomes are weak. The hallmark examples are in environmental policy. For example, if the emission of sulphur dioxide is suspected to lead to acid rain and in turn large scale forest death, the hazard is too great to wait for the scientific consensus to settle before limiting sulphur dioxide emissions by law, even if only provisionally.</p>
<p>The example of sulphur dioxide and forest death is an actual case that motivated the forerunners of the precautionary principle. It is a case where nowadays the limiting action is understood as proper, and where accelerating the rollback of sulphur dioxide emissions probably was wise. The principle has also been used to prevent possible problems from manifesting. Especially in Europe, the very high hurdles to overcome for approval of genetically modified crops are for example justified because of the <em>suspected</em> hazards of growing and eating such crops.</p>
<p>Principles benefit from a certain simplicity. But to settle what the principle does and doesn’t do, additional clarity is needed. I will argue that the principle does very little other than function as a rhetorical tool. It is as much a creature of political competition as all other tools of discourse. Rhetorical tools can certainly be useful, but unexamined, they may obscure biases and create false certainty.</p>
<h1>How Great and How Uncertain the Hazard?</h1>
<p>The precautionary principle would never apply to hazards that are small, relative to the scale of the society or ecosystem as a whole. These types of hazards can be managed by normal risk management methods, like hedging or insurances or some other price signal, like tax rates. And by definition, failure to manage those hazards optimally is itself manageable. There is therefore a threshold question in the application of the precautionary principle: what is a great enough hazard to relax the criterion of certainty?</p>
<p>A hazard that is great and also very certain would also <em>not</em> need a special principle. That is a situation more akin to ongoing war, where taking <em>some</em> action for survival is not in doubt. The strongest case for action is to point to a great hazard that will most certainly materialize absent some intervention. The precautionary principle is meant to bring that sense of urgency to cases where certainty is meaningfully lower.</p>
<p>The more challenging question is how great the uncertainty can be to still support acting on precaution. In other words, how speculative can the case be that some intervention will prevent a great hazard? One lone person with a theory and keyboard would not be enough, nor would one simulated trajectory of events out of a billion trajectories. Some minimum threshold credibility is still required.</p>
<h1>Nature, the Safe Harbour With Fuzzy Boundaries</h1>
<p>The precautionary principle grew out of environmental concerns with pollution and natural destruction in the late 20th century. Precaution is then applied to the addition to, or alteration of, nature. Both the regulations to curb sulphur dioxide emissions and the great legal hurdles to genetic engineering are about a kind of closeness to nature and a given natural order.</p>
<p>This echoes the conservative maxim of Chesterton’s Fence, which describes that we ought to err on letting the designs we encounter stand, because they were in all likelihood created for a good reason, but a reason that has since receded from memory. The difference is that this maxim is meant to defer to inherited wisdom of earlier human generations, while the precautionary principle conceives the natural world as its place of safe return. If in doubt, let the natural state be what we defer to.</p>
<p>The precautionary principle and its practice have a wider reach, however. Human health straddles the natural and human spheres. For example, many nowadays are concerned that social media and the rapid reward system of digital feeds, readily accessible through smartphones, have made many people more depressed, angrier and less able to form <em>healthy</em> human relationships. Had this concern existed in the early 2010s, even at low certainty, the precautionary principle, or some close descendant thereof, might still have applied by appealing to the natural state as the thing to preserve, while additional facts are gathered.</p>
<p>The boundaries of nature are not self-evident, nor is nature uniform in character. That means when a social choice is contemplated, it is debatable both if the change to the state of affairs impacts nature or not, or, if at least two features of nature are in competition, which should weigh the greatest. For example, genetically engineered crops can require less use of pesticide or require less artificial fertilizers, which <em>might</em> enable in one regard a more natural state of affairs, since pesticide and fertilizers have their own side-effects, be they established or conjectured. These side-effects would need to be balanced against the concerns of genetic engineering.</p>
<h1>Decisions-Making Like All Other Decision-Making</h1>
<p>The two previous sections noted the vagueness of scope for the principle. Four issues were described: the magnitude of the hazard, what passes as adequate support for the proposed causal relationship, what qualifies as natural, and how competing concerns about nature are weighed.</p>
<p>In the hallmark example of sulphur dioxide emissions, the precautionary principle did not lead to a total ban. The final regulations took a measured approach and balanced trade-offs. Examples of this outcome in emissions regulations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the European Union, sulphur dioxide emissions from shipping are capped at 0.1% in designated Sulphur Emission Control Areas and 0.5% globally. For industry, monthly average emissions must not exceed 1,700 mg per normal cubic metre.  </li>
<li>In the United States, the Acid Rain Program uses a cap-and-trade system, setting a national cap on sulphur dioxide emissions from power plants and allowing companies to trade emission allowances. The national cap is reducing annually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genetically engineered crops in Europe, though highly regulated with associated costs and delay, are still available (<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/food/food-feed-portal/screen/gmo/search">around one-hundred approved and registered</a> at the time of writing). Precaution in this area has therefore ended up in an arduous process of approval, but where trade-offs and argumentation are possible. For example, some such crops are approved for import and sale, but not for cultivation, which illustrates that different parts of the natural environment are considered differently.</p>
<p>In order to apply the principle appropriately to social decision, the same concerns as any other decision are considered, and in terms of outcomes, where the principle has ostensibly been part of the process, no clear qualitative difference in outcome is discernible. The apparent simplicity of the principle is not evident in process or outcome, it looks very much like any other risk-benefit analysis based on arguments and educated guesses.</p>
<p>The part that may be distinct is that the precautionary principle makes rule-making and implementation progress quicker with lower evidence hurdles. The European Union has proven quite apt at passing regulations quicker than comparable jurisdictions. Whether that can be attributed to the precautionary principle, rather than differences in how law is made at the European level, is debatable. In  one regard, I think the principle matters, but <em>not</em> because it has brought a missing perspective or greater urgency into the decision process.</p>
<h1>Signals of Trust and Common Concern</h1>
<p>A recurring theme in European political rhetoric is <em>trust</em>. In public communication by regulators and policy makers, the explicit claim is frequently made that a regulation is created and enacted in order to engender consumer trust and consequently consumer adoption of whatever is being regulated. For example, the aim of the EU AI Act is stated in EU’s own communication as “to foster trustworthy AI in Europe.” </p>
<p>I think the precautionary principle is best understood in this context. </p>
<p>For a highly consequential social decision, without much certainty, any method of decision-making is fraught. In the democratic deliberative context, the methods include presentation of evidence and arguments for a putative cause-effect relation, communication of the case why there is an urgency to act, and which future state of affairs is preferable, all trade-offs considered. This is true also when the precautionary principle is invoked. Therefore, if the principle is doing something, it is doing it outside the immediate decision-making.</p>
<p>I think the key audience is the public. The invocation of the precautionary principle signals that particular concern has been given by decision-makers to nature, or more broadly, that which is sacred to the public. Building trust and legitimation are the desired outcome, because without it, the public may oppose and rebel against the choice and the decision-makers. The principle sanctifies the decision-making — precaution was paid — without requiring the decision-makers to make the public fully informed of the evidence for or against a hypothesized cause-effect relation.</p>
<p>In this framing, it is similar to how the <em>national interest</em> was used in political rhetoric and legitimation in earlier eras (and perhaps the emerging one). Strenuous collective effort was justified because it was in the national interest, as the national interest was understood. </p>
<p>With the benefit of hindsight, a great deal that was justified that way proved to not be in the national interest, even on its own stated terms. And if we accept a critique of the national interest as the overarching interest, then we can question why we should be compelled to join the collective effort. Only if we already have accepted national interest as carrying moral weight, and if we accept that the leader invoking it is acting on it, either by his arguments or by our trust in him, does the utterance of national interest matter. It is not a self-evident anchor, rather a signal that carries ethical weight because people have accepted it as such.</p>
<p>In the public discourse, the precautionary principle serves structurally the same role. It is a means to concentrate already held concerns into a tool to coordinate people on shared efforts that come with burdens.</p>
<h1>Examined and Unexamined Anchors</h1>
<p>When I encounter mentions of the precautionary principle, I am often struck that precaution points in a different direction than I think it ought to. For example, in the debate in 2011 when Germany decided in the wake of the Fukushima disaster to close all German nuclear power plants within a decade, the hazard of meltdown and storage of radioactive waste, despite low probabilities of disaster or severe contamination, was in the public debates considered high enough to favour the precaution of closure. </p>
<p>However, the substitution of nuclear energy with at least in large parts Russian natural gas was always problematic, both from a global warming and political view. The higher electricity price that did result from the closure, also created economic contraction with its downstream hazards to the social fabric. Precaution could just as well have favoured more nuclear power.</p>
<p>So why was precaution so firmly on the side of closure? If we rather ask, why are many Germans so concerned about nuclear meltdown and ready to act decisively on it, I think all kinds of historical, political and philosophical hypotheses can be offered and contemplated. That is not a specific question I concern myself with here. Precaution, rather, was firmly on the side of closure because for one reason or another, very many Germans were so inclined, and ready to take on the considerable effort and associated costs, as they were understood then, to enact that radical energy policy.</p>
<p>I picture the precautionary principle as one step on a path to arrive at coordinated action at social scale when possible hazards are high. It can help to close the gap between conviction and action under the conditions of modern democratic societies, where deliberation, bureaucracy and participation create hurdles to major change. But the principle is often invoked as if it was a pre-political given. As I argued above, that is hardly the case. The principle rests on thresholds and arguments of relevance and scope, which means many could claim to act according to it, but without agreeing on what those acts are.</p>
<p>To view the principle as guiding the decision-making in a direct sense is therefore wrong. It constrains how the case can be made and communicated to legitimate a tough decision. </p>
<h1>The Problem With the Principle</h1>
<p>It bothers me how often I see the precautionary principle, in fact or in spirit, invoked in support of decisions I think are bad. My reaction in the past was to interpret it as yet another case of good intentions turning into a flawed at best, destructive at worst, principle of action. For the reasons outlined, even as a critic of the principle, I have come to view it less as a cause of the bad I see, and more as the form bad <em>and good</em> often is made to take in, at least, European deliberation and communication. It is not the <em>but-for</em> factor in the bad decisions I observe.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I do not think the principle should simply be viewed as empty words wrapped around already held beliefs and biases among the majority of the population. It is in itself instructive that claims of protecting and preserving nature are the means by which more daring action with potentially strenuous demands on the citizen are legitimized. A principle without force to coordinate people at social scale would not proliferate. </p>
<p>So a deeper commitment is revealed by the principle and its invocation elicits these commitments to the issue at hand. If national interest, or worse, fear of invasion by bad guys, is the only way to get people in democratic nations to act beyond present-time self-interests we are worse off than if concern for nature also can prompt such action.</p>
<p>The lack of strong limiting factors for the precautionary principle means however it is overused and readily employed in service of <em>not</em> having to win the hard-earned argument for a policy. Believing, for example, that shutting down nuclear power accords with precaution is at first understandable. But if one must also acknowledge that removing said hazards came by way of expanding natural gas use, enriching exporters, and making domestic heavy industry non-competitive, the choice is no longer as clear-cut, even within a narrow concern for nature. The precautionary principle invites an unexamined approach.</p>
<p>It is time to step away from appeals to precaution. Not because a compact signal for the concern of nature is bad, but rather because it has become a mask for thinking and debating honestly. I see decisions that require social-scale coordination left unaddressed, while others that deserve a more examined approach settle too quickly on whichever side has been granted the reduced standard of proof in law and public deliberation. I believe the principle is unfit for the moment.</p>
