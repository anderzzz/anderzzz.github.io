  <h2>Parasitic Quoting of "Kafka"</h2>
  <time datetime="2026-01-27">27 January 2026</time>

  <blockquote>
<p>"I was ashamed of myself when I realized life was a costume party and I attended with my real face."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words carry a great deal of profundity. They read like an introvert’s admission of shame as he recognizes that so many around him know how to appear in the world in ways that serve some end, all in opportunistic flux, changed to fit time and place. The shamed introvert wonders how much more he could be if only he was not burdened by being himself, inside or out.</p>
<p>The quote circulates through the digital networks, to emerge at regular intervals when it has earned enough likes and reshares. </p>
<p>The quote in its digital form is attributed to Franz Kafka. He was by all accounts a man well acquainted with paranoia, angst and awkwardness. Nowadays his name has become an adjective to describe something imbued with surreal distortion and disorientation. During his relatively short life, though, Franz Kafka saw no fame or success on account of his writing. He was not a man for the costume parties.</p>
<p>It is easy to picture Franz Kafka, the author of those tormented novels, holding a sentiment like the one quoted above. </p>
<p>But would he really phrase it in such terms? </p>
<p>I recall from my readings, Kafka writing in a weirdly matter-of-fact way, where, say, Gregor Samsa is not feeling or acting like a bug, but actually being a bug, or the labyrinths of bureaucracy appearing as actual labyrinths. And though we are invited inside the minds of the protagonists, they are not self-reflective guys, rather more often seeming like a stage for those uneasy sensations to register on. Metaphors and interiority are not the style I associate with Kafka. The quoted passage is conflicting with expectations.</p>
<p>And in fact, trying to find the source of this quote, nobody can quite trace it to Franz Kafka. Who phrased the introverted mood this way first is unclear, who associated Kafka’s name to it is also lost in the eddies of the digital networks. But the evidence is against it having been coined by Franz Kafka, that remarkable dead man in old grand Prague.</p>
<p>At one level of analysis, we begin with the free-flying signifiers divorced from what they at face-level are meant to signify. Had the subject matter been political, “disinformation” would have been the label slapped on it. For the quote in question, politics is hardly a factor why Kafka is claimed to be its originator. Maybe it is rather  something Pavlovian driving the read-click circuit? This is a level of analysis that typically concludes with calls for institutions of fact-checking and expertise, or simply in sorrow over what the high-scroll-rate content has wrought on art and literature.</p>
<p>At another level of analysis, I think I see noise and parasitism in cultural transmission, all unthinking consequences of the supercharged world of symbols that play out through the networks. I want to take a closer look at that.</p>
<p>First I should say that I have always resisted the more fanciful philosophy that claims that language and discourse constructs reality and truth. Atoms are quite capable at slapping back at anything too misfit. Still, many claims do things at a level well-removed from the reach of atomic slap-backs.</p>
<p>The quoted passage attributed to Kafka, for example, seems like it operates by rules that have little to do with atoms. Since Kafka has been dead for just over a hundred years, he has no say, either. His desire to have his manuscripts burned at the end of his life might mean he wouldn’t even want to clarify himself.</p>
<p>When I first encountered Kafka it was by way of Jean-Paul Sartre’s existentialist interpretations of Kafka’s writings. So in a sense, I was already engaging with “Kafka”, the author of tormented stories, only this was not some introverted, on-the-spectrum avatar, but a chronicler of the condition of bad faith in the face of complete freedom.</p>
<p>If I was a writer of Sartre’s attributes, I could however imagine an extended exposition of Kafka through the lens of the neuroatypical. The dissonance felt when encountering rules that don’t compute, the strange sense of self especially amongst those who enjoy the simple bourgeois pleasures, and the non-heroic sacrifice. In that hypothetical, Kafka’s texts might be part of the symbols by which we build the scaffolding to grasp a phenomenon. If the interpretation reflects the actual man’s true psychology is then an irrelevant issue, because it is not the man, but the symbols, we are commenting on.</p>
<p>I think the force of the misattributed quote stems in part from that multiplying thoughts on, and sentiments about, the neuroatypical are in search for symbols and designs to hook into for cultural scaffolding. Coherence and reasonableness might follow, at least within one bubble among many.</p>
<p>In that view, the quote is like a hallucination in the network of symbols. Not true in relation to the man Franz Kafka. Yet, the collective hallucination reveals sizable enough needs and beliefs in the contemporary network. The cultural transmission may be very noisy, but also creative, as it then births new symbols, like the “Kafka” who is quoted above.</p>
<p>At this point, I like to note the eerie self-referential nature of the quote and above analysis. The quote, probably created by an introverted person with a gift for the poetic and an affinity for metaphor, failed to gain likes and shares with its actual attribution. But given the mask of “Kafka”, the esteemed author of the anxious and absurd, the quote acquired greater prominence in the virtual world. It was no longer just itself, and thus the quote carried greater heft. </p>
<p>It would be quite humorous (not to mention fractal) if the quote, the symbol, only became what it is through enacting its own lesson about the costume party of symbols. </p>
<p>I do not mean to excuse that a likely falsehood is spread. And if Kafka’s genuine writings and distorting books are not read, only his aphorisms and computed summaries, hallucinated or not, then we have lost something good. Truth and high art are worth the fight.</p>
<p>However, I think in this quote we observe an instance of symbol change by way of parasitism. The desire, at least online, to bring coherence to an issue like the socially uneasy persons of the world, grabs hold of a symbol. </p>
<p>Sartre, before cultural networks had a digital dimension, did something similar when he interpreted Kafka as an observer of the existentialist life. Sartre’s efforts were more serious, intentional and elaborate, and I’d rate them higher for that reason than the accumulation of rapid clicks of like buttons. Nonetheless, he engaged in a process that put meaning into “Kafka”, derived from the man Franz Kafka. In that sense, I think we should view the misattributed quote as a great deal more than something to add to the fact-checkers’ workload.</p>
<p>Maybe the misattribution began as a mistake, maybe as engagement baiting, and it is a distortion of the truth in a key sense. But it is more than that. It is illustrative of how networks of interactive symbols can come to be imbued with moods and needs of the world they are in, and not de novo, but by parasitism of given symbols, twisting them to fit what some slice of the world needs. And those needs are present and real.</p>
