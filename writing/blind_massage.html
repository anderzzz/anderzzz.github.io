  <h2>Blind Massage in Taiwan</h2>
  <time datetime="2026-01-15">15 January 2026</time>

  <p>The Fifth Shogun, a ruler of 17th century Japan, still leaves his mark on the people of Taiwan. You can feel it. </p>
<p>Before a longhaul flight, if it is possible, it helps in my experience to have a brief massage. It readies the lower back to endure through sleeplessness and a leaned over posture. </p>
<p>What one notices then in Taiwan is that many of the very best massagers are brought out from the back, led by cane or a supporting man or woman, and they wear glasses, blacked-out at times. The massages one can get in Taiwan are often administered with powerful grasp and reasonable price by visually impaired men and women.</p>
<p>When I wondered why that is, I was told it was some kind of communitarian welfare, perhaps, not as mere cash transfers, but as state-guided job marketplace integration. Sounds interesting, I thought, as work is more than a way to earn some cash, but also a path to social integration, a reason to acquire a duty and act on it, and perhaps in the process even feel that sense of self-worth.</p>
<p>Still, visually impaired selling massage seemed too specific to simply be explained in terms of a rational calculus of welfare practice. Why this way?</p>
<p>Imperial Japan, like Medieval Europe, had the institutional practice of guilds. What we would call economic activity today, were divided up into institutions that managed what and who was done. It was more than economic policy, it was social design. These were complex designs, flawed and awesome at the same time. A great deal of history has been created on their account.</p>
<p>A special group among them was <a href="https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1191062852280475649.html">the todoza</a>, a mutual support group for blind men, who also monopolized certain activities, like music, acupuncture and massage. A key figure in this development was <a href="https://sugiyamawaichi-kengyou.com/english/about-us/acupuncture-moxibustion-and-anma-museum/">Sugiyama Waichi</a>, a blind acupuncturist who became the court physician of Tokugawa Tsuneyoshi (the 5th Shogun). The story goes that the 5th Shogun appreciated his physician and supported his work to make the blind useful in Japanese society. Thus the Shogun with his regal powers granted said monopoly to blind men of his realm.</p>
<p>This practice endured through the centuries into modern Japan, and was instituted in Taiwan as well, when that island was under Japanese rule between 1895 and 1945. Noteworthy, the same transfer took place from Japan to South Korea around the same time.</p>
<p>The story could have ended here, like a curious echo of imperial Japanese expansion, which after defeat in 1945, fades away. But this was not the end, as the effects are still visible and felt in Taiwan, even absent the power of empire or guilds.</p>
<p>In the late 1990s the issue returned. This time barbers in Taiwan wanted to be able to sell massage services. However, there was a political reaction with protests. Taiwan’s first visually impaired legislator, <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/鄭龍水">Zheng Longshui</a> became a driving force to formalize the practice into law, so as to reserve an occupation and source of income for the blind. Finally, in 1997, a law was passed that in part ensured massage in Taiwan would legally be done only by the visually impaired. Thus the Shogun’s design became protected by law, created through a democratic process.</p>
<p>But this was not the end–how could it be? Protection like that for some meant limits for others. Also, this is protection based on a mostly immutable feature, which no effort or training by individuals can overcome. Thus, under the relatively liberal rule of Taiwan, a constitutional challenge would emerge sooner or later. </p>
<p>Specifically in 2008 when the <a href="https://cons.judicial.gov.tw/en/docdata.aspx?fid=100&amp;id=310830">constitutional court of Taiwan ruled in order 649</a> that the limitation of massage to the visually impaired was no longer good law. They argue that the discrimination could no longer be justified because massage services had broadened in scope and that the visually impaired had become more employable in other occupations and were no longer as dependent on the protection as they presumably once were. So by the standard of proportionality, the law created too great constraints for too little benefit, and was thus struck down.</p>
<p>It is also notable that some visually impaired Taiwanese have since expressed that the state supported protection had perpetuated a stereotype, which <a href="https://international.thenewslens.com/article/75783">hurt more than it helped</a>. Massage services over many hours is hard work and not generally considered a high status occupation. So protection in that frame turned into a not always wanted expectation. This echoes some of the criticisms of the designs of affirmative action, where the affirmation itself works as stigma.</p>
<p>So it would seem the Fifth Shogun’s command is on its last leg in Taiwan. </p>
<p>The blind and visually impaired may still be able to offer excellent services—I’ve seen arguments that the visually impaired should be predisposed to finding the strained muscle, given their greater dependence on touch. Even if true, though, there are more sighted people, and the loss of legal protections should mean that as old businesses are replaced with new ones, fewer will be operated by the visually impaired. </p>
<p>The arguments against the Shogun’s design in contemporary society are straightforward. The modern world is organized around the individual with high regard for individual autonomy, and the modern world has created wealth and comforts well above anything even kings of old had access to. Guilds are offensive to that form of organization.</p>
<p>Occupational licensing may still be common and can in principle at least be justified on grounds of common quality standards and removal of information asymmetries in the marketplace. However, to legally limit who is granted a license on any other ground than the relevant skill is an uphill climb – not impossible to overcome, but still, the burden to justify it is on the one asking for the exception.</p>
<p>Taiwan is clearly more liberal than Imperial Japan ever was, arguably Taiwan is one of the most liberal contemporary states. So directionally, the change makes sense.</p>
<p>I have thought more about this as discussions have ramped up about Artificial Intelligence and wide-scale job redundancies, universal basic income, post-scarcity communism, and so on, not to mention the forced isolation and work-from-home mandates that the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in. It is clear that for many, work is more than a set time of trading labour for cash. Shogun’s design merits another look.</p>
<p>In the broadest sense, work, or some component of humans engaging in it, generates welfare. This is not to say all work is rewarding, or even if it is, not necessarily in the moment. But it must be compared against a meaningful alternative, say a once-a-month welfare check added to one’s bank account.</p>
<p>I expect that the visually impaired face greater challenges than most to be part of efforts involving other humans, or to play ordinary social games to become employed or given a chance to be useful. They literally have a harder time to find their peers and the places where they can derive that welfare working affords. Some challenges are treated as matters of healthcare within our welfare states, where specialized doctors and equipment are part of the healthcare institutions for the visually impaired.</p>
<p>The wisdom in Shogun’s design is that it is not medical or simply compensation for loss of income relative to some standard. Shogun’s design, in its modern form, is paternalistic and economically inefficient. It imposes a welfare generating design on part of society through partial command and control of commerce. It creates a duty within a figurative guild for visually impaired persons.</p>
<p>Is this kind of welfare solution worth the inefficiency and illiberal undertones? </p>
<p>To answer that specifically for the visually impaired of Taiwan, I would need to dig deeper into the specifics, like what are the social institutions and work available in contemporary Taiwan. If indeed there are many other opportunities to acquire duty and welfare, broadly understood, then we should prioritize efficiency and autonomy. That was the justification of the ruling by the Taiwanese constitutional court. I have no additional data or insight on these specifics.</p>
<p>I think however the question can be put in a general form. Given some group of citizens, who by some fact of their constitution, is less able to engage in the dominant style of social games to find duty, purpose and associated welfare, then how much paternalism should we tolerate to address that failure of the community under standard liberal governance? </p>
<p>Or perhaps, what forms of paternalism do we tolerate under an otherwise mostly liberal governance? Because if the only civil institutions that can command duty or integrate the outliers are healthcare ones, then I predict that many things will be routed through the medical establishments and the doctor’s diagnosis and pharmacist’s stash of pills elevated to an unworthy status. Turning citizens into patients, to be diagnosed and corrected, has many downsides.</p>
<p>So the question is worth asking, the tension recognized, if not always resolved satisfactorily. A broader conception of welfare, especially as it concerns work and duty, and the unexamined distinctions we make between kinds of paternalism, may yield unexpected answers. </p>
<p>I assume my massages in Taiwan before travel will continue to be administered by someone visually impaired, at least for a time. Their shops are still common, affordable and appropriately tough, so greatly recommended. </p>
<p>Next time, though, my thoughts will drift to the Fifth Shogun and his designs. For all their obvious tensions with the liberal paradigm of governance, the designs are still with us, albeit in a muted form, and their wisdom may yet find new application as welfare is contemplated in our new world. Is that a hope or a warning? Yes to both.</p>
