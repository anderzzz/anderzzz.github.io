  <h2>Stories We Tell</h2>
  <time datetime="2025-12-14">14 December 2025</time>

  <p>In my past, I worked creating new types of luminaires, or artificial lighting. During an inspired moment of content creation, as it was so bluntly called, and under the influence of a marketing book we had been recommended (Made to Stick, by Heath and Heath), I suggested an introduction to our story something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagine the world two million years ago, our distant ancestors, Homo Erectus, moving across the lands, gathering and hunting by day, huddled by night. Perhaps a mouthful of cold root mush to go with the fear of lurking predators in the dark. That is, until the invention of fire. Two million years ago, the best pre-historical evidence tells us, the invention of artificial lighting took place, when fire came under our ancestor’s control. Today, as we speak, we are taking the greatest step forward since that awesome event, two million years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was appropriately dialed back before anything was made public. </p>
<p>My ironic attempt to join our daily grind and entrepreneurial tribulations to a two million years history is part of a genre of argument that draws its heft from a long history, or at least a longer history than those other people. That something contemporary, which I am invited to become part of, can be, more or less credibly, traced back deep into history seems to play a role. </p>
<p>History makes for great narratives, like cultural fodder for hungry minds. Most of the time, I think that is what it really is about. We like to listen to good stories, which means good story-tellers gain influence, and history provides the rich and varied pigments for the artist to paint on the canvas. </p>
<p>In the entrepreneurial work I do nowadays with Language Models, I ended up fusing the early Middle Ages and mid-century modernism for company aesthetics and narrative. It was inspiration and atmospherics, not anything deeper, perhaps another example of postmodern bricolage. </p>
<p>Or is it? The postmodern surface perspective lacks something. Though I am free and able to blend what I know into a playful and useful product, it is not a random selection, nor is the blend meant to deconstruct or shock, rather a deeper set of beliefs, aspiration and faith even take form in the story and aesthetics I weave. </p>
<p>Strange they are, these stories we tell about what we are building and the places we build in. Like a slow surfacing of commitments I did not know I held, beliefs that chose their symbols before I noticed. The honest answer is that I’m still mid-sentence, still finding out which kind of story this is. At least I don’t think we can be without a story.</p>
